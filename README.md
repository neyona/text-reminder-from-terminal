# text-reminder-from-terminal
This is a short Python program that uses Twilio. It is used to send a text from terminal to a cell phone if the sender has set up a Twilio account. The beginning of the program has a description of how to run it. I used python==3.7.4 (Other versions of Python 3 should work as well) and twilio==6.19.2 which I installed with pip3==19.1.1.
